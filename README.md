# Community Portal Project

## Overview

Home Page Overview:
The homepage serves as a central hub for the community, welcoming visitors with a dynamically generated message and highlighting upcoming events. It begins with a shared header, followed by a personalized welcome message sourced from homeData. Below that, an events section presents community activities, with each event displayed dynamically from the sortedUpcomingEvents array. The events are filtered to show only those occurring within the next week, ensuring the homepage remains relevant and up to date. The events are also sorted chronologically, making it easy for visitors to see what's happening soon. The layout alternates event placement for visual balance, enhancing readability (right side events / left side events).

About Page Overview:
The About Us page provides an overview of the organization and introduces its community team in a structured layout. It begins with a shared header and a dynamically generated organization bio, ensuring that any updates are reflected automatically. The team section highlights each member's name, surname, profile picture, and brief personal bio, all sourced dynamically from an array. This setup allows for easy content management, keeping the page up to date without requiring that much manual edits.
